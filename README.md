# Market News web application
## Technologies
- python flask
- HTML, CSS
## Feature
- If you select the category, then it will collect the news data from finnhub API
- unfortunately, all the data is same even though you choose different category. I think the API I used here is free API, so data is not enough.

## FeedBack 
- Through this project, I could try to build web page through flask library and recap python, HTML, CSS knowledges.
